= Using {ConsoleName}

[[console-overview]]
== Console Overview

The console is an HTML based web site that displays information about a qpid dispatch router network.

The console requires an HTML web server that can serve static html, javascript, style sheets, and images.

The console only provides limited information about the clients that are attached to the router network and is therfore more appropriate for administrators needing to know the layout and health of the router network.

[[console-installation]]
== Console Installation

[discrete]
=== Prerequisites

The following need to be installed before running a console:

* One or more dispatch routers. See the documentation for the dispatch
router for help in starting a router network.
* A websockets to tcp proxy.
* A web server. This can be any server capable of serving static
html/js/css/image files.

[discrete]
=== Procedure

To install a websockets to tcp proxy:

----
sudo dnf install python-websockify
websockify localhost:5673 localhost:5672
----

This will start the proxy listening to ws traffic on port 5673 and
translating it to tcp on port 5672. One of the routers in the network
needs to have a listener configured on port 5672. That listener's role
should be 'normal'. For example:

----
listener {
   host: 0.0.0.0
   role: normal
   port: amqp
   saslMechanisms: ANONYMOUS
}
----

[[the-console-files]]
=== The Console Files

The files for the console are located under the console/stand-alone
directory in the source tree
*  'index.html'
*  'plugin/'

Copy these files to a directory under the the html or webapps directory
of your web server. For example, for apache tomcat the files should be
under webapps/dispatch. Then the console is available as 'http://localhost:8080/dispatch'

The Autostart checkbox, when checked, will automatically log in with the previous host:port the next time you start the console.
