[[getting_started]]
= Getting Started

Before configuring {RouterName}, you should understand how to start the router, how it is configured by default, and how to use it in a simple peer-to-peer configuration. 

[[starting_the_router]]
== Starting the Router

.Procedure

// Step 1 for starting the router.
include::{FragmentDir}/fragment-starting-router-step.adoc[]
+
[NOTE]
====
You can specify a different configuration file with which to start the router. For more information, see xref:methods_for_changing_router_configuration[_Changing a Router's Configuration_].
====
+
The router starts, using the default configuration file stored at `/etc/qpid-dispatch/qdrouterd.conf`. 

. View the log to verify the router status:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
$ qdstat --log
----
+
This example shows that the router was correctly installed, is running, and is ready to route traffic between clients:
+
[options="nowrap"]

It provides the `$management` address, through which management tools such as `qdmanage` and `qdstat` can perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on the router. As an AMQP endpoint, the management agent supports all operations defined by the link:https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/54441/AMQP%20Management%20v1.0%20WD09[AMQP management specification (Draft 9)].

== Routing Messages in a Peer-to-Peer Configuration

// XXX Calling this peer-to-peer poses some problems.  It's also
// technically client-server in this instance, and most people think
// those two things are exclusive.

This example demonstrates how the router can connect clients by receiving and sending messages between them. It uses the router's default configuration file and does not require a broker.

.Peer-to-peer Communication
image::01-peer-to-peer.png[Peer-to-peer Communication, align="center"]

As the diagram indicates, the configuration consists of an {RouterName} component with two clients connected to it: a sender and a receiver. The receiver wants to receive messages on a specific address, and the sender sends
messages to that address. 

A broker is not used in this example, so there is no _"store and forward"_ mechanism in the middle. Instead, the messages flow from sender to receiver only if the receiver is online, and the sender can confirm that the messages have arrived at their destination.

This example uses a {ClientAmqpPythonName} client to start a receiver client, and then send five messages from the sender client.

.Prerequisites

{ClientAmqpPythonName} must be installed before you can complete the peer-to-peer routing example. For more information, see {ClientAmqpPythonUrl}.

.Procedure

. xref:starting_the_receiver_client[Start the receiver client].
. xref:sending_messages[Send messages].

[[starting_the_receiver_client]]
=== Starting the Receiver Client

In this example, the receiver client is started first. This means that the messages will be sent as soon as the sender client is started.

[NOTE]
====
In practice, the order in which you start senders and receivers does not matter. In both cases, messages will be sent as soon as the receiver comes online.
====

.Procedure

* To start the receiver by using the Python receiver client, navigate to the Python examples directory and run the `simple_recv.py` example:
+
--
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ cd __INSTALL_DIR__/examples/python/
$ python simple_recv.py -a 127.0.0.1:5672/examples -m 5
----

This command starts the receiver and listens on the default address (`127.0.0.1:5672/examples`). The receiver is also set to receive a maximum of five messages.
--

[[sending_messages]]
=== Sending Messages

After starting the receiver client, you can send messages from the sender. These messages will travel through the router to the receiver.

.Procedure

* In a new terminal window, navigate to the Python examples directory and run the `simple_send.py` example:
+
--
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ cd __INSTALL_DIR__/examples/python/
$ python simple_send.py -a 127.0.0.1:5672/examples -m 5
----

This command sends five auto-generated messages to the default address (`127.0.0.1:5672/examples`) and then confirms that they were delivered and acknowledged by the receiver:

[options="nowrap"]
----
all messages confirmed
----

The receiver client receives the messages and displays their content:

[options="nowrap"]
----
{u'sequence': 1L}
{u'sequence': 2L}
{u'sequence': 3L}
{u'sequence': 4L}
{u'sequence': 5L}
----
