[[router_network_connections]]
= Network Connections

Connections define how the router communicates with clients, other routers, and brokers. You can configure _incoming connections_ to define how the router listens for data from clients and other routers, and you can configure _outgoing connections_ to define how the router sends data to other routers and brokers.

[[adding_incoming_connections]]
== Listening for Incoming Connections

Listening for incoming connections involves setting the host and port on which the router should listen for traffic.

.Procedure

. In the router's configuration file, add a `listener`:
+
--
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
listener {
    host: _HOST_NAME/ADDRESS_
    port: _PORT_NUMBER/NAME_
    ...
}
----

`host`:: Either an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) or hostname on which the router should listen for incoming connections.
`port`:: The port number or symbolic service name on which the router should listen for incoming connections.

For information about additional attributes, see xref:router_configuration_file_listener[Listener] in the _Configuration Reference_.
--

. If necessary, xref:securing_incoming_connections[secure the connection].
+
If you have set up SSL/TLS or SASL in your environment, you can configure the router to only accept encrypted or authenticated communication on this connection.

. If you want the router to listen for incoming connections on additional hosts or ports, configure an additional `listener` entity for each host and port.

[[adding_outgoing_connections]]
== Adding Outgoing Connections

Configuring outgoing connections involves setting the host and port on which the router should connect to other routers and brokers.

.Procedure

. In the router's configuration file, add a `connector`:
+
--
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
connector {
    name: _NAME_
    host: _HOST_NAME/ADDRESS_
    port: _PORT_NUMBER/NAME_
    ...
}
----

`name`:: The name of the `connector`. You should specify a name that describes the entity to which the connector connects. This name is used by configured addresses (for example, a `linkRoute` entity) in order to specify which connection should be used for them.
`host`:: Either an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) or hostname on which the router should connect.
`port`:: The port number or symbolic service name on which the router should connect.

For information about additional attributes, see xref:router_configuration_file_connector[Connector] in the _Configuration Reference_.
--

. If necessary, xref:securing_outgoing_connections[secure the connection].
+
If you have set up SSL/TLS or SASL in your environment, you can configure the router to only send encrypted or authenticated communication on this connection.

. For each remaining router or broker to which this router should connect, configure an additional `connector` entity.
