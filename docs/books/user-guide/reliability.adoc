[[reliability]]
= Reliability

////
There's a lot of really good information here, but most of it is best-suited at a level higher than this book. This book is really about configuring a router in an established topology, but most of the information in "Reliability" is about concepts and best practices to keep in mind as you design the topology. Alternatively, I could also see taking the examples presented here and turning them into a tutorial to teach some of the fundamental concepts inherent within router reliability.
////

In general, in a broker based architecture, the reliability feature is strictly related to the "store and forward" mechanism offered by each broker. Thanks to persistent journals, a broker can offer fault tolerance thus avoiding message loss; of course, it is not so true when messages are stored only in a volatile memory.

This is completely different using {RouterName}, because each router neither takes ownership of messages nor stores them in a persistent storage. In this case, the reliability feature is offered by *path redundancy* which provides the possibility to reach the destination on different paths through the router network. In normal conditions, the best path is always chosen in terms of lowest cost but, when one or more routers go down, the topology is revisited by all remained routers and new paths are processed in order to reach always each destination. Of course, it means that the reliability is strictly related to the network topology the user chooses for his solution.

Because a solution based on {RouterName} could be made not only by routers but by brokers too, the reliability is improved with persistent storage on them which add not only fault tolerance but temporal decoupling as well; without "store and forward" feature offered by brokers, the temporal decoupling is not possible only with routers and direct peers, both senders and receivers; the receiver must be online at same time of the sender in order to receive messages.

== Path Redundancy

Offering path redundancy means designing the network topology in a way that even when one or more routers go down or even connections between them, each destination is always reachable following alternate paths through the routers that are still part of the network.

Consider the following simple scenario :

* a network with three routers "Router.A", "Router.B" and "Router.C".
* the "Router.A" is connected to both "Router.B" and "Router.C".
* the "Router.C is connected to the "Router.B".
* all three routers listen for client connections.
* a sender client connects to the "Router.A" in order to send messages to a receiver client.
* a receiver client connects to the "Router.B" initially in order to receive messages from the sender peer.

The "Router.A" configuration is something like following.

[options="nowrap"]
----
router {
    mode: interior
    id: Router.A
}

listener {
    host: 0.0.0.0
    port: 6000
    authenticatePeer: no
}

connector {
    name: INTER_ROUTER_B
    addr: 127.0.0.1
    port: 5001
    role: inter-router
}

connector {
    name: INTER_ROUTER_C
    addr: 127.0.0.1
    port: 5002
    role: inter-router
}
----

There is only one _listener_ in order to accept client connections and two _connector_ entities for connecting to the other two routers.

The "Router.B" configuration is the following.

[options="nowrap"]
----
router {
    mode: interior
    id: Router.B
}

listener {
    addr: 0.0.0.0
    port: 5001
    authenticatePeer: no
    role: inter-router
}

listener {
    host: 0.0.0.0
    port: 6001
    authenticatePeer: no
}
----

It has two _listener_ entities in order to listen for connections from clients and from other routers in the network (in this case from the "Router.A" and "Router.C").

Finally, quite similar is the "Router.C" configuration.

[options="nowrap"]
----
router {
    mode: interior
    id: Router.C
}

listener {
    addr: 0.0.0.0
    port: 5002
    authenticatePeer: no
    role: inter-router
}

listener {
    host: 0.0.0.0
    port: 6002
    authenticatePeer: no
}

connector {
    name: INTER_ROUTER_B
    addr: 127.0.0.1
    port: 5001
    role: inter-router
}
----

It has two _listener_ entities in order to listen for connections from clients and from other routers in the network (in this case from the "Router.A") and finally it has a _connector_ (for connecting to the "Router.B")

Consider a sender client connected to "Router.A" and attached to `my_address` address which start to send messages (that is, 10 messages) and a receiver client connected to the "Router.B" and attached to the same address.

Starting the receiver, it waits for messages with no output on the console.

[options="nowrap"]
----
# python simple_recv.py -a localhost:6001/my_queue -m 10
----

Starting the sender, all the messages flow through "Router.A" and "Router.B" reaching the receiver; at this point the messages are all confirmed at sender side.

[options="nowrap"]
----
# python simple_send.py -a localhost:6001/my_queue -m 10
all messages confirmed
----

At same time, the receivers shows the messages received through the "Router.B".

[options="nowrap"]
----
{u'sequence': 1L}
{u'sequence': 2L}
{u'sequence': 3L}
{u'sequence': 4L}
{u'sequence': 5L}
{u'sequence': 6L}
{u'sequence': 7L}
{u'sequence': 8L}
{u'sequence': 9L}
{u'sequence': 10L}
----

The path redundancy is provided by the other available path through the "Router.A", "Router.C" and then "Router.B". It means that if the connection between "Router.A" and "Router.B" goes down, the alternative path is used to reach the receiver.

Now, consider a fault on the "Router.B"; the receiver is not reachable anymore on that path but it can connect to the "Router.C" in order to continue to receive messages from the sender which does not know what's happened and it can continue to send messages to the "Router.A" in order to reach the receiver.

The receiver is still reachable in order to get messages from the sender as displayed in the console output.

== Path Redundancy and Temporal Decoupling

In order to have temporal decoupling in a solution based on {RouterName}, adding one or more brokers is a must for its "store and forward" feature. Choosing the right topology, it is possible to have a solution which offers reliability with both path redundancy and permanent storing for messages.

Consider the following simple scenario :

* a network with three routers "Router.A", "Router.B" and "Router.C" and finally a broker.
* the "Router.A" is connected to both "Router.B" and "Router.C".
* initially only the "Router.B" is connected to the broker.
* all three routers listen for client connections.
* a sender client connects to the "Router.A" in order to send messages to a queue in the broker.
* a receiver client connects to the "Router.A" in order to get messages from the queue in the broker.

.Path Redundancy and Temporal Decoupling Enabled Topology
image::path-redundancy-temp-decoupling-01.png[Path Redundancy and Temporal Decoupling Enabled Topology, align="center"]

The receiver client can be offline when the sender starts to send messages because they'll be stored into the queue permanently; coming back online, the receiver can get messages from the queue itself without message loss.

The "Router.A" configuration is something like following.

[options="nowrap"]
----
router {
    mode: interior
    id: Router.A
}

listener {
    host: 0.0.0.0
    port: 6000
    authenticatePeer: no
}

connector {
    name: INTER_ROUTER_B
    addr: 127.0.0.1
    port: 5001
    role: inter-router
}

connector {
    name: INTER_ROUTER_C
    addr: 127.0.0.1
    port: 5002
    role: inter-router
}

address {
    prefix: my_queue
    waypoint: yes
}
----

It has a _listener_ for accepting incoming connections from clients and two _connector_ entities in order to connect to the other routers. The queue named `my_queue` on the broker is exposed by a waypoint.

The "Router.B" configuration is the following.

[options="nowrap"]
----
router {
    mode: interior
    id: Router.B
}

listener {
    addr: 0.0.0.0
    port: 5001
    authenticatePeer: no
    role: inter-router
}

listener {
    host: 0.0.0.0
    port: 6001
    authenticatePeer: no
}

connector {
    name: BROKER
    addr: 127.0.0.1
    port: 5672
    role: route-container
}

address {
    prefix: my_queue
    waypoint: yes
}

autoLink {
    addr: my_queue
    connection: BROKER
    dir: in
}

autoLink {
    addr: my_queue
    connection: BROKER
    dir: out
}
----

It can accept incoming connections from clients and from other routers (in this case the "Router.A") and connects to the broker. The queue named `my_queue` on the broker is exposed by a waypoint with the related auto-links in both directions in order to send and receive messages to/from the queue itself.

Finally, the simple "Router.C" configuration.

[options="nowrap"]
----
router {
    mode: interior
    id: Router.C
}

listener {
    addr: 0.0.0.0
    port: 5002
    authenticatePeer: no
    role: inter-router
}

listener {
    host: 0.0.0.0
    port: 6002
    authenticatePeer: no
}
----

It can accept incoming connections from clients and from other routers (in this case the "Router.A"). Initially there is no connection between this router and the broker.

First of all, thanks to the broker and its "store and forward" feature, the sender can connect to the "Router.A" and start to send messages even if the receiver is not online in that moment. Using the Python sample from the Qpid Proton library, the console output is like following.

[options="nowrap"]
----
# python simple_send.py -a localhost:6000/my_queue -m 10
all messages confirmed
----

All messages are confirmed because they reached the queue inside the broker through "Router.A" and "Router.B"; it is confirmed using the `qdstat` tool.

For the "Router.B", there are 10 messages as input (from the broker to the router) on the `my_queue` address.

Now, consider a fault on the "Router.B"; in this case the broker is not reachable but it is possible to set up path redundancy through the "Router.C".

The "Router.C" configuration changes in the same way as "Router.B". It can accept incoming connections from clients and from other routers (in this case the "Router.A") and connects to the broker. The queue named `my_queue` on the broker is exposed by a waypoint with the related auto-links in both directions in order to send and receive messages to/from the queue itself.

For the "Router.C", there are 10 messages as output (from the router to the broker) on the `my_queue` address.

Starting the receiver connected to the "Router.A", it gets all the available messages from the queue.

For the "Router.C", there are 10 messages as input (from the broker to the router) on the `my_queue` address.

== Sharded Queue

Every broker has limits in terms of queue size but in order to overcome this problem, one possible solution is "sharding" queues : in that way a single queue is divided in more "shards" (chunks) each on a different broker. It means that such solution needs more than one broker instance in order to host a shard on each of them. Of course, a sender connected to one of these brokers can send messages to the shard hosted only on that broker. At same time, a receiver connected to a broker can get messages from the shard that is hosted on that broker and can not see available messages in the shards hosted on the other brokers, even if they are all parts of the same queue.

[NOTE]
====
Even if speaking about shards it is obvious that they are real queues all with same name but on different brokers. The "shard" concept is an abstract one because finally a shard is a real queue stored on a broker.
====

The big problem in this scenario, designed only with brokers, is that a receiver can be stucked on an empty shard without reading any messages while the shards on the other brokers have messages to deliver. it is a real problem because the receiver is interested in receiving messages from the whole queue and it does not take care if it is shared or not. Because of this problem, the receiver sees the queue as empty even if it is not so true due to the sharding and the messages available on the other shards.

The above problem can be solved adding a {RouterName} instance in the network in front of the brokers and leverage on its waypoint feature with related auto-links.

Consider the following simple scenario :

* a network with one router "Router.A" and two brokers.
* the "Router.A" listens for clients connections and it is connected to both brokers.
* the brokers host shards for a queue; each broker has one shard.
* a sender client connects to the "Router.A" in order to send messages to the queue.
* a receiver client connects to the "Router.A" in order to get messages from the queue.

.Sharded Queue Enabled Topology

With such solution and connecting to the "Router.A", sender and receiver do not know anything about sharding; they want send and receive messages to/from the whole queue that is the only thing they are aware of. They are both connected to the router and see only one address (related to the queue).

The "Router.A" configuration is something like following.

[options="nowrap"]
----
router {
    mode: standalone
    id: Router.A
}

listener {
    host: 0.0.0.0
    port: 6000
    authenticatePeer: no
}

connector {
    name: BROKER1
    addr: 127.0.0.1
    port: 5672
    role: route-container
}

connector {
    name: BROKER2
    addr: 127.0.0.1
    port: 5673
    role: route-container
}

address {
    prefix: my_queue
    waypoint: yes
}

autoLink {
    addr: my_queue
    connection: BROKER1
    dir: in
}

autoLink {
    addr: my_queue
    connection: BROKER1
    dir: out
}

autoLink {
    addr: my_queue
    connection: BROKER2
    dir: in
}

autoLink {
    addr: my_queue
    connection: BROKER2
    dir: out
}
----

The router has a _listener_ for incoming connection from clients and two _connector_ instances in order to connect to both brokers. The whole queue is named `my_queue` hosted in terms of shards on both brokers and the router is configured with a waypoint for that address. Finally, there are two auto-links in both directions for that queue on both brokers.

Using the Python sample from the Qpid Proton library, the sender can connect to the "Router.A" and start to send messages to the queue; the console output is like following.

[options="nowrap"]
----
# python simple_send.py -a localhost:6000/my_queue -m 10
all messages confirmed
----

All messages are confirmed because they reached the queue and, thanks to the default `balanced` distribution on the address, the messages are delivered to both shards on the brokers (5 messages per shard). Using the `qdstat` tool on the router, the distribution is clear.

There are the `out` links (from router to brokers) for the `my_queue` address (_id_ values `7` and `9`) which have each 5 deliveries. It shows messages distributed across brokers and related shards for the queue; it is confirmed by the different connections they are tied (_conn id_ values `1` and `2`).

Starting the receiver connected to the "Router.A", it gets all the available messages from the queue.

There are the `in` links (from brokers to router) for the `my_queue` address (_id_ values `6` and `8`) which have each 5 deliveries. It shows messages distributed across brokers and related shards for the queue; it is confirmed by the different connections they are tied (_conn id_ values `1` and `2`).

One disadvantage of sharded queues is that the receiver might receive messages "out of order" even with very good performance.
