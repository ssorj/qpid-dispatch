[[routing]]
= Routing

Routing is the process by which messages are delivered to their destinations. To accomplish this, {RouterName} provides two routing mechanisms: _message routing_ and _link routing_.

Message routing:: Routing is performed on messages as producers send them to a router. When a message arrives on a router, the router routes the message and its _settlement_ based on the message's _address_ and _routing pattern_.
+
--
.Message Routing
image::message-routing.png[Message Routing, align="center"]

In this diagram, the message producer attaches a link to the router, and then sends a message over the link. When the router receives the message, it identifies the message's destination based on the message's address, and then uses its routing table to determine the best route to deliver the message either to its destination or to the next hop in the route. All dispositions (including settlement) are propagated along the same path that the original message transfer took. Flow control is handled between the sender and the router, and then between the router and the receiver.
--

Link routing:: Routing is performed on link-attach frames, which are chained together to form a virtual messaging path that directly connects a sender and receiver. Once a link route is established, the transfer of message deliveries, flow frames, and dispositions is performed across the link route.
+
--
.Link Routing
image::link-routing.png[Link Routing, align="center"]

In this diagram, a router is connected to clients and to a broker, and it provides a link route to a queue on the broker (my_queue). The sender connects to the router, and the router propagates the link-attaches to the broker to form a direct link between the sender and the broker. The sender can begin sending messages to the queue, and the router passes the deliveries along the link route directly to the broker queue.
--

== Comparison of Message Routing and Link Routing

While you can use either message routing or link routing to deliver messages to a destination, they differ in several important ways. Understanding these differences will enable you to choose the proper routing approach for any particular use case.

=== When to Use Message Routing

Message routing is the default routing mechanism. You can use it to route messages on a per-message basis between clients directly (direct-routed messaging), or to and from broker queues (brokered messaging).

Message routing is best suited to the following requirements:

* Default, basic message routing.
+
{RouterName} automatically routes messages by default, so manual configuration is only required if you want routing behavior that is different than the default.

* Message-based routing patterns.
+
Message routing supports both anycast and multicast routing patterns. You can load-balance individual messages across multiple consumers, and multicast (or fan-out) messages to multiple subscribers.

* Sharding messages across multiple broker instances when message delivery order is not important.
+
Sharding messages from one producer might cause that producer's messages to be received in a different order than the order in which they were sent.

Message routing is not suitable for any of the following requirements:

* Dedicated path through the router network.
+
For inter-router transfers, all message deliveries are placed on the same inter-router link. This means that the traffic for one address might affect the delivery of the traffic for another address.

* Granular, end-to-end flow control.
+
With message routing, end-to-end flow control is based on the settlement of deliveries and therefore might not be optimal in every case.

* Transaction support.

* Server-side selectors.

=== When to Use Link Routing

Link routing requires more detailed configuration than message routing as well as an AMQP container that can accept incoming link-attaches (typically a broker). However, link routing enables you to satisfy more advanced use cases than message routing.

You can use link routing if you need to meet any of the following requirements:

* Dedicated path through the router network.
+
With link routing, each link route has dedicated inter-router links through the network. Each link has its own dedicated message buffers, which means that the address will not have "head-of-line" blocking issues with other addresses.

* Sharding messages across multiple broker instances with guaranteed delivery order.
+
Link routing to a sharded queue preserves the delivery order of the producer's messages by causing all messages on that link to go to the same broker instance.

* End-to-end flow control.
+
Flow control is "real" in that credits flow across the link route from the receiver to the sender.

* Transaction support.
+
Link routing supports local transactions to a broker.

* Server-side selectors.
+
With a link route, consumers can provide server-side selectors for broker subscriptions.

== Configuring Message Routing 

With message routing, routing is performed on messages as producers send them to a router. When a message arrives on a router, the router routes the message and its _settlement_ based on the message's _address_ and _routing pattern_.

With message routing, you can do the following:

* Route messages between clients (direct-routed, or brokerless messaging)
+
This involves configuring an address with a routing pattern. All messages sent to the address will be routed based on the routing pattern. 
* Route messages through a broker queue (brokered messaging)
+
This involves configuring a waypoint address to identify the broker queue and then connecting the router to the broker. All messages sent to the waypoint address will be routed to the broker queue.

=== Addresses

Addresses determine how messages flow through your router network. An address designates an endpoint in your messaging network, such as:

* Endpoint processes that consume data or offer a service
* Topics that match multiple consumers to multiple producers
* Entities within a messaging broker:
** Queues
** Durable Topics
** Exchanges

When a router receives a message, it uses the message's address to determine where to send the message (either its destination or one step closer to its destination).

// Do we need to specify that these are AMQP addresses? Should they be distinguished from generic message addresses?

// Need to add something here about the difference between discovered vs. configured mobile addresses so that it's clear that with message routing, the router can either be proactive or reactive in the way it routes messages.

[[routing_patterns_overview]]
=== Routing Patterns

Each address has one of the following routing patterns, which define the path that a message with the address can take across the messaging network:

Balanced:: An anycast method that allows multiple consumers to use the same address. Each message is delivered to a single consumer only, and {RouterName} attempts to balance the traffic load across the router network.
+
--
If multiple consumers are attached to the same address, each router determines which outbound path should receive a message by considering each path's current number of unsettled deliveries. This means that more messages will be delivered along paths where deliveries are settled at higher rates.

[NOTE]
====
{RouterName} neither measures nor uses message settlement time to determine which outbound path to use.
====

In this scenario, the messages are spread across both receivers regardless of path length:

.Balanced Message Routing
image::balanced-routing.png[Balanced Message Routing, align="center"]
--

Closest:: An anycast method in which every message is sent along the shortest path to reach the destination, even if there are other consumers for the same address.
+
{RouterName} determines the shortest path based on the topology cost to reach each of the consumers. If there are multiple consumers with the same lowest cost, messages will be spread evenly among those consumers.
+
In this scenario, all messages sent by `Sender` will be delivered to `Receiver 1`:
+
.Closest Message Routing
image::closest-routing.png[Closest Message Routing, align="center"]

Multicast:: Messages are sent to all consumers attached to the address. Each consumer will receive one copy of the message.
+
In this scenario, all messages are sent to all receivers:
+
.Multicast Message Routing
image::multicast-routing.png[Multicast Message Routing, align="center"]

=== Message Settlement

Message settlement is negotiated between the producer and the router when the producer establishes a link to the router. Depending on the settlement pattern, messages might be delivered with any of the following degrees of reliability:

* At most once
* At least once
* Exactly once

{RouterName} treats all messages as either _pre-settled_ or _unsettled_, and it is responsible for propagating the settlement of each message it routes.

Pre-settled:: Sometimes called _fire and forget_, the router settles the incoming and outgoing deliveries and propagates the settlement to the message's destination. However, it does not guarantee delivery.

Unsettled:: The router propagates the settlement between the sender and receiver, and guarantees one of the following outcomes:
+
* The message is delivered and settled, with the consumer's disposition indicated.
* The delivery is settled with a disposition of `RELEASED`.
+
This means that the message did not reach its destination.
* The delivery is settled with a disposition of `MODIFIED`.
+
This means that the message might or might not have reached its destination. The delivery is considered to be "in-doubt" and should be re-sent if "at least once" delivery is required.
* The link, session, or connection to {RouterName} was dropped, and all deliveries are "in-doubt".

[[routing_messages_between_clients]]
=== Routing Messages Between Clients

You can route messages between clients without using a broker. In a brokerless scenario (sometimes called _direct-routed messaging_), {RouterName} routes messages between clients directly.

To route messages between clients, you configure an address with a routing distribution pattern. When a router receives a message with this address, the message is routed to its destination or destinations based on the address's routing distribution pattern.

.Procedure

. In the router's configuration file, add an `address` section:
+
--
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
address {
    prefix: _ADDRESS_PREFIX_
    distribution: balanced|closest|multicast
    ...
}
----

`prefix`:: The address prefix. All messages that match this prefix will be distributed according to the distribution pattern you specify.
+
//tag::prefix-matching[]
The prefix can match either an exact address or a segment within an address that is delimited by either a `.` or `/` character. For example, the prefix `my_address` would match the address `my_address` as well as `my_address.1` and `my_address/1`. However, it would not match `my_address1`.
//end::prefix-matching[]

`distribution`:: The message distribution pattern. The default is `balanced`, but you can specify any of the following options:
+
* `balanced` - Messages sent to the address will be routed to one of the receivers, and the routing network will attempt to balance the traffic load based on the rate of settlement.
* `closest` - Messages sent to the address are sent on the shortest path to reach the destination. It means that if there are multiple receivers for the same address, only the closest one will receive the message.
* `multicast` - Messages are sent to all receivers that are attached to the address in a _publish/subscribe_ model.
+
For more information about message distribution patterns, see xref:routing_patterns_overview[Routing Patterns].

For information about additional attributes, see xref:router_configuration_file_address[Address] in the _Configuration Reference_.
--

. Add the same `address` section to any other routers that need to use the address.
+
The `address` that you added to this router configuration file only controls how this router distributes messages sent to the address. If you have additional routers in your router network that should distribute messages for this address, then you must add the same `address` section to each of their configuration files.

[[routing_messages_through_broker]]
=== Routing Messages Through a Broker Queue

You can route messages to and from a broker queue to provide clients with access to the queue through a router. In this scenario, clients connect to a router to send and receive messages, and the router routes the messages to or from the broker queue.

You can route messages to a queue hosted on a single broker, or route messages to a _sharded queue_ distributed across multiple brokers.

.Brokered Messaging
image::brokered-messaging.png[Brokered Messaging, align="center"]

In this diagram, the sender connects to the router and sends messages to my_queue. The router attaches an outgoing link to the broker, and then sends the messages to my_queue. Later, the receiver connects to the router and requests messages from my_queue. The router attaches an incoming link to the broker to receive the messages from my_queue, and then delivers them to the receiver. 

You can also route messages to a _sharded queue_, which is a single, logical queue comprised of multiple, underlying physical queues. Using queue sharding, it is possible to distribute a single queue over multiple brokers. Clients can connect to any of the brokers that hold a shard to send and receive messages.

.Brokered Messaging with Sharded Queue
image::sharded-queue-02.png[Brokered Messaging with Sharded Queue, align="center"]

In this diagram, a sharded queue (my_queue) is distributed across two brokers. The router is connected to the clients and to both brokers. The sender connects to the router and sends messages to my_queue. The router attaches an outgoing link to each broker, and then sends messages to each shard (by default, the routing distribution is `balanced`). Later, the receiver connects to the router and requests all of the messages from my_queue. The router attaches an incoming link to one of the brokers to receive the messages from my_queue, and then delivers them to the receiver.

.Procedure

. xref:configure_waypoint_address[Add a waypoint address].
+
This address identifies the queue to which you want to route messages.
. xref:connect_router_to_broker[Add autolinks to connect the router to the broker].
+
Autolinks connect the router to the broker queue identified by the waypoint address.

. xref:connect_router_to_broker[If the queue is sharded, add autolinks for each additional broker that hosts a shard].

[[configure_waypoint_address]]
==== Configuring Waypoint Addresses

A waypoint address identifies a queue on a broker to which you want to route messages. You need to configure the waypoint address on each router that needs to use the address. For example, if a client is connected to _Router A_ to send messages to the broker queue, and another client is connected to _Router B_ to receive those messages, then you would need to configure the waypoint address on both _Router A_ and _Router B_.

.Prerequisites

An incoming connection (`listener`) to which the clients can connect should be configured. This connection defines how the producers and consumers connect to the router to send and receive messages. For more information, see xref:adding_incoming_connections[Adding Incoming Connections].

// Does the broker queue have to exist before you create the waypoint address? If it doesn't exist, will you get an error?

.Procedure

* Create waypoint addresses on each router that needs to use the address:
+
--
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
address {
    prefix: _ADDRESS_PREFIX_
    waypoint: yes
}
----

`prefix`:: The address prefix that matches the broker queue to which you want to route messages.
+
//tag::prefix-matching[]
The prefix can match either an exact address or a segment within an address that is delimited by either a `.` or `/` character. For example, the prefix `my_address` would match the address `my_address` as well as `my_address.1` and `my_address/1`. However, it would not match `my_address1`.
//end::prefix-matching[]

`waypoint`:: Set this attribute to `yes` so that the router handles messages sent to this address as a waypoint.
--

[[connect_router_to_broker]]
==== Connecting a Router to the Broker

After you add waypoint addresses to identify the broker queue, you must connect a router to the broker using autolinks.

With autolinks, client traffic is handled on the router, not the broker. Clients attach their links to the router, and then the router uses internal autolinks to connect to the queue on the broker. Therefore, the queue will always have a single producer and a single consumer regardless of how many clients are attached to the router.

. If this router is different than the router that is connected to the clients, then add the waypoint address.

. Add an outgoing connection to the broker:
+
--
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
connector {
    name: _NAME_
    host: _HOST_NAME/ADDRESS_
    port: _PORT_NUMBER/NAME_
    role: route-container
    ...
}
----

`name`:: The name of the `connector`. Specify a name that describes the broker.
`host`:: Either an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) or hostname on which the router should connect to the broker.
`port`:: The port number or symbolic service name on which the router should connect to the broker.
`role`:: Specify `route-container` to indicate that this connection is for an external container (broker).

For information about additional attributes, see xref:router_configuration_file_connector[Connector] in the _Configuration Reference_.
--

. If you want to send messages to the broker queue, create an outgoing autolink to the broker queue:
+
--
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
autoLink {
    addr: _ADDRESS_
    connection: _CONNECTOR_NAME_
    dir: out
    ...
}
----

`addr`:: The address of the broker queue. When the autolink is created, it will be attached to this address.
`externalAddr`:: An optional alternate address for the broker queue. You use an external address if the broker queue should have a different address than that which the sender uses. In this scenario, senders send messages to the `addr` address, and then the router routes them to the broker queue represented by the `externalAddr` address.
`connection` | `containerID`:: How the router should connect to the broker. You can specify either an outgoing connection (`connection`) or the container ID of the broker (`containerID`).
`dir`:: Set this attribute to `out` to specify that this autolink can send messages from the router to the broker.

For information about additional attributes, see xref:router_configuration_file_autolink[autoLink] in the _Configuration Reference_.
--

. If you want to receive messages from the broker queue, create an incoming autolink from the broker queue:
+
--
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
autoLink {
    addr: _ADDRESS_
    connection: _CONNECTOR_NAME_
    dir: in
    ...
}
----

`addr`:: The address of the broker queue. When the autolink is created, it will be attached to this address.
`externalAddr`:: An optional alternate address for the broker queue. You use an external address if the broker queue should have a different address than that which the receiver uses. In this scenario, receivers receive messages from the `addr` address, and the router retrieves them from the broker queue represented by the `externalAddr` address.
`connection` | `containerID`:: How the router should connect to the broker. You can specify either an outgoing connection (`connection`) or the container ID of the broker (`containerID`).
`dir`:: Set this attribute to `in` to specify that this autolink can receive messages from the broker to the router.

For information about additional attributes, see xref:router_configuration_file_autolink[autoLink] in the _Configuration Reference_.
--

=== Example: Routing Messages Through Broker Queues

This example shows how waypoints and autolinks can route messages through a pair of queues on a broker.

==== Router Configuration

[options="nowrap"]
----
connector {  // <1>
    name: broker
    role: route-container
    host: 198.51.100.1
    port: 61617
    saslMechanisms: ANONYMOUS
}

address {  // <2>
    prefix: queue
    waypoint: yes
}

autoLink {  // <3>
    addr: queue.first
    dir: in
    connection: broker
}

autoLink {  // <4>
    addr: queue.first
    dir: out
    connection: broker
}

autoLink {  // <5>
    addr: queue.second
    dir: in
    connection: broker
}

autoLink {  // <6>
    addr: queue.second
    dir: out
    connection: broker
}
----
<1> The outgoing connection from the router to the broker. The `route-container` role enables the router to connect to an external AMQP container (in this case, a broker).
<2> The namespace queue on the broker to which the router should route messages. All addresses that start with `queue` will be routed to a queue on the broker.
<3> The incoming autolink from `queue.first` on the broker to the router.
<4> The outgoing autolink from the router to `queue.first` on the broker.
<5> The incoming autolink from `queue.second` on the broker to the router.
<6> The outgoing autolink from the router to `queue.second` on the broker. 

==== How the Messages are Routed

Initially, when the broker is offline, the autolinks are inactive.

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ qdstat --autolinks
AutoLinks
  addr          dir  phs  extAddr  link  status    lastErr
  ========================================================
  queue.first   in   1                   inactive
  queue.first   out  0                   inactive
  queue.second  in   1                   inactive
  queue.second  out  0                   inactive
----

Once the broker is online, the autolinks attempt to activate. In this case, the broker starts with the `queue.first` queue only, and the `queue.first` autolinks become active. The `queue.second` autolinks are in a failed state, because the `queue.second` queue does not exist on the broker.

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ qdstat --autolinks
AutoLinks
  addr          dir  phs  extAddr  link  status  lastErr
  ===========================================================================
  queue.first   in   1             6     active
  queue.first   out  0             7     active
  queue.second  in   1                   failed  Node not found: queue.second
  queue.second  out  0                   failed  Node not found: queue.second
----

The producer now connects to the router and sends three messages to `queue.first`.

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ python simple_send.py -a 127.0.0.1/queue.first -m3
all messages confirmed
----

The router's address statistics show that the messages were delivered to the queue.

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ qdstat -a
Router Addresses
  class   addr           phs  distrib   in-proc  local  remote  cntnr  in  out  thru  to-proc  from-proc
  ========================================================================================================

  mobile  queue.first    0    balanced  0        1      0       0      3   3    0     0        0
----

The `queue.first` address appears twice in the output: once for each phase of the address. Phase 0 is for routing messages from producers to the outgoing autolink. Phase 1 is for routing messages from the incoming autolink to the subscribed consumers. In this case, Phase 0 of the address has counted three messages in the `in` column (the messages that arrived on the router from the producer), and three messages in the `out` column (the messages that were sent from the router to the broker queue).

The consumer now connects to the router and receives the three messages from `queue.first`.

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ python simple_recv.py -a 127.0.0.1:5672/queue.first -m3
{u'sequence': int32(1)}
{u'sequence': int32(2)}
{u'sequence': int32(3)}
----

The router's address statistics now show that all three messages were received by the consumer from the broker queue.

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ qdstat -a
Router Addresses
  class   addr           phs  distrib   in-proc  local  remote  cntnr  in  out  thru  to-proc  from-proc
  ========================================================================================================
  mobile  queue.first    1    balanced  0        0      0       0      3   3    0     0        0
  mobile  queue.first    0    balanced  0        1      0       0      3   3    0     0        0
----

The command output shows that Phase 1 of the address was used to deliver all three messages from the queue to the consumer.

[NOTE]
====
Even in a multi-router network, and with multiple producers and consumers for `queue.first`, all deliveries are routed through the queue on the connected broker.
====

== Configuring Link Routing

Link routing provides an alternative strategy for brokered messaging. A link route represents a private messaging path between a sender and a receiver in which the router passes the messages between end points. You can think of a link route as a "virtual connection" or "tunnel" that travels from a sender, through the router network, to a receiver.

With link routing, routing is performed on link-attach frames, which are chained together to form a virtual messaging path that directly connects a sender and receiver. Once a link route is established, the transfer of message deliveries, flow frames, and dispositions is performed across the link route.

=== Link Route Addresses

A link route address represents a broker queue, topic, or other service. When a client attaches a link route address to a router, the router propagates a link attachment to the broker resource identified by the address. 

=== Link Route Routing Patterns

Routing patterns are not used with link routing, because there is a direct link between the sender and receiver. The router only makes a routing decision when it receives the initial link-attach request frame. Once the link is established, the router passes the messages along the link in a balanced distribution.

=== Link Route Flow Control

Unlike message routing, with link routing, the sender and receiver handle flow control directly: the receiver grants link credits, which is the number of messages it is able to receive. The router sends them directly to the sender, and then the sender sends the messages based on the credits that the receiver granted.

// What additional information do we need to provide about AMQP link flow control options? Since this is handled on the client side for link routing, should we provide a simple example with a client program that implements link flow control?

[[creating_link_route]]
=== Creating a Link Route
 
Link routes establish a link between a sender and a receiver that travels through a router. You can configure inward and outward link routes to enable the router to receive link-attaches from clients and to send them to a particular destination.

With link routing, client traffic is handled on the broker, not the router. Clients have a direct link through the router to a broker's queue. Therefore, each client is a separate producer or consumer.

----

Client `C1` is constrained by firewall policy to connect to the router in its own network (`Rb`). However, it can use a link route to access queues, topics, and any other AMQP services that are provided on message brokers `B1` and `B2` -- even though they are on different networks.

In this example, client `C1` needs to receive messages from `b2.event-queue`, which is hosted on broker `B2` in `Private Net A`. A link route connects the client and broker even though neither of them is aware that there is a router network between them.

==== Router Configuration

To enable client `C1` to receive messages from `b2.event-queue` on broker `B2`, router `Ra` must be able to do the following:

* Connect to broker `B2`
* Route links to and from broker `B2`
* Advertise itself to the router network as a valid destination for links that have a `b2.event-queue` address.

The relevant part of the configuration file for router `Ra` shows the following:

--
[options="nowrap"]
---- 
connector {  // <1>
    name: broker
    role: route-container
    host: 198.51.100.1
    port: 61617
    saslMechanisms: ANONYMOUS 
}

linkRoute {  // <2>
    prefix: b2
    dir: in
    connection: broker
}

linkRoute {  // <3>
    prefix: b2   
    dir: out
    connection: broker
}
----
<1> The outgoing connection from the router to broker `B2`. The `route-container` role enables the router to connect to an external AMQP container (in this case, a broker).
<2> The incoming link route for receiving links from client senders. Any sender with a target whose address begins with `b2` will be routed to broker `B2` using the `broker` connector.
<3> The outgoing link route for sending links to client receivers. Any receivers whose source address begins with `b2` will be routed to broker `B2` using the `broker` connector.
--

This configuration enables router `Ra` to advertise itself as a valid destination for targets and sources starting with `b2`. It also enables the router to connect to broker `B2`, and to route links to and from queues starting with the `b2` prefix.

[NOTE]
====
While not required, routers `Rp` and `Rb` should also have the same configuration. 
==== 

==== How the Client Receives Messages

By using the configured link route, client `C1` can receive messages from broker `B2` even though they are on different networks.

Router `Ra` establishes a connection to broker `B2`. Once the connection is open, `Ra` tells the other routers (`Rp` and `Rb`) that it is a valid destination for link routes to the `b2` prefix. This means that sender and receiver links attached to `Rb` or `Rp` will be routed along the shortest path to `Ra`, which then routes them to broker `B2`.

To receive messages from the `b2.event-queue` on broker `B2`, client `C1` attaches a receiver link with a source address of `b2.event-queue` to its local router, `Rb`. Because the address matches the `b2` prefix, `Rb` routes the link to `Rp`, which is the next hop in the route to its destination. `Rp` routes the link to `Ra`, which routes it to broker `B2`. Client `C1` now has a receiver established, and it can begin receiving messages.

[NOTE]
====
If broker `B2` is unavailable for any reason, router `Ra` will not advertise itself as a destination for `b2` addresses. In this case, routers `Rb` and `Rp` will reject link attaches that should be routed to broker `B2` with an error message indicating that there is no route available to the destination.
